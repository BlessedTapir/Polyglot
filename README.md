### Team battle

First of all, we need to collect enough common problems to start with, we can allow users to come up with their own questions and answers.

The idea is to allow users to make multiple choices questions that can challenge others. Users can assign to different teams (tribes, “houses” following Harry Porter language). When user A fails at a quiz, user A and their team “Alpha” lose point.

If user B comes up with a really hard question, when other users fail at it, user B and their team “Beta” win points.

There has to be a mechanism to determine the difficulty of a question. Only reasonably difficult questions are considered when points are calculated.

ASSESSING DIFFICULTY: Before we calculate points based on a question, it first needs to be shown to 100 or maybe 10 random users (“pilot group”). A “difficulty heuristic” will be given based on how well and easily they solve this problem.

DOWNSIDE: If we go with this idea, the name “Polyglot” will no longer be useful.
